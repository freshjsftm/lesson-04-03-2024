        <p>Hardcore is a variant of Survival and one of the main game modes in Minecraft. In this mode, the world is locked to Hard difficulty and the player cannot respawn after dying.</p>

        <p>The key feature of Hardcore mode is that the player is not given the option to respawn upon death as they would in other game modes. Instead, there are two buttons on the death screen: "Spectate world" and "Title screen". "Spectate world" sets the player to Spectator mode and respawns the player at the world's spawn point, making them able to view and explore the world only in that mode. The "Title screen" button simply leads the player to the main menu screen; re-opening the world simply returns the player back to the same death screen as before. Respawn anchors do not resurrect players in Hardcore mode.</p>
        <p>In addition, Hardcore mode worlds are restricted to Hard difficulty, being the second key feature.</p>
        <p>When creating a Hardcore mode world, the Enable Cheats and Bonus Chest world options are locked to OFF. On the world selection menu, Hardcore mode worlds display dark red text reading "Hardcore Mode!"</p>
